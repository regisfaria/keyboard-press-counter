# Keyboard presses counter

## Overview
Lately I was wondering how many key presses are being done when I'm coding. So this code aims to give me that answer.

## Installation and Running
Just install the following py module and run: 

```python
pip3 install keyboard
python3 counter.py keyboard_to_stop_counting
```

I'm using python v3.6.9.

The final count will be given in the terminal. If someone else I know(or if you want to contribute) maybe I'll make a .txt file that gets updated daily
